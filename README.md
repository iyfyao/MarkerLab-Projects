CAR ROBOT - Build a shitty robot using arduino that go straight for 1 meter and move in a square direction.

We decided to branch independently the two wheels in order to make the turn by having the 2 motors going at different speeds.

We encountered some issues because the 2 motors were not equally powerful, one was going quicker than the other. So we had to setup the "going straight" speed of each motor separately (one at 180 and the other one at 60).

Also its important to know that the motors were going in opposite direction. By setting up both robot at 180 speed the wheels were turning in different direction. Because we had to figure out manually the correct speed to give each motor so the robot would go straight, the robot was only going approximately straight.

IDE and features : Arduino IDE, Arduino Board, Power supply, 2 servo motors, C++

Our robot moves forward over 1 meter then make a square turn.
